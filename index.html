        <h1>Beowulf - How is the theme developed?</h1>
        <p class="modern">
            Unflinching loyalty to one's nation is an integral element in <i>Beowulf</i>. This is generally coupled with the extreme levels of pride for oneself and one's nation found in Anglo-Saxon society. This combination of loyalty and pride leads to Beowulf being placed into a precarious situation that could've been easily avoidable. When the dragon begins attacking Geatland, Beowulf realizes that he's grown old, and doesn't have quite as much strength as he had when he defeated Grendel many years ago. He understands that he "risked [his] life often when [he] was young," but "Now [he is] old." (Line 2511) Despite this, he values loyalty to his nation above all, which causes him to "pursue this fight for the glory of winning" (Line 2511) and entrench himself in an irrational battle he knew he wasn't likely to win. Unlike the concept of loyalty depicted in "Loyalty to the Flag," <i>Beowulf</i>'s loyalty is much more personal, and characters throughout the epic intentionally take on hardships in order to prove the extent of their loyalty. For example, Beowulf "was too proud to line up with a large army against the sky-plague" (Line 2345), and instead went with a small company, telling them "I shall win the gold by my courage, or else mortal combat, doom of battle, will bear your lord away." (Line 2535) This loyalty eventually caused Beowulf's death, which would've been easily preventable if he had simply sacrificed some of his pride and individualistic loyalty by bringing a larger army to fight the dragon. After Beowulf dies, he is commemorated by a barrow and celebrated for years to come throughout society, always remembered for his heroic actions and committed loyalty to his nation.
